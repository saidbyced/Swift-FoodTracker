#  Food Tracker iOS App

Please note that this is not my app and I have no ownership of the code therein. It should (mostly) match the code on Apple's ['Develop iOS Apps Swift'](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html) website. The exception to them matching is where the tutorial has not kept up to date with the latest version of XCode or Swift, forcing me to implement XCode suggested work-arounds. Enjoy.
